# Simple Login With Google

This is a simple **login with google** app template, made with Appwrite

## Run this thing
You will need to use a development build, run `eas build` to create one.

After that, create a .env file, and set the `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` and `APPWRITE_PLATFORM` values with your appwrite data.
Make sure that you have the Google oAuth provider enabled in your Appwrite Console.

Dont forget to run `npm install`, to install the dependencies.
Now, run the app with `npx expo start` and it should work!
